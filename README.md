# HTML & CSS Tutorial Repository

Welcome! This repository is designed to help you learn HTML and CSS step by step. Each folder represents a lesson where you'll:
- Learn a concept through examples.
- Practice with exercises.
- Check your solutions to improve. (Do try the exercise before looking at the solutions, this will help you learn)

2. Read the lesson `README.md`.
3. Open the `example.html` file to see a demonstration.
4. Complete the `exercise.md`.

### Terminology
- `Repository`: a repository is a storage location where your project files and their revision history are managed, often using version control systems like Git (future tutorial). It helps keep track of changes, collaborate with others, and organise your code or content.
- `Directory`: a directory is like a folder which contains files. It is used to organise files on a computer or in a project structure.
- `File types`:
- - `.html`: HTML files are used to create the structure and content of web pages. They use tags to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.
- - `.md`: Markdown (.md) files are used to write formatted text using plain text. They are commonly used for documentation, README files, and blogs, allowing easy conversion to HTML for web display.
