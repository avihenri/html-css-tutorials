# Exercise: HTML Headings

## Overview

In this exercise, you will practice using HTML heading tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) to organise and structure content on a webpage. Headings are used to define sections of your content, with `<h1>` being the most important and `<h6>` the least important.

By the end of this exercise, youâ€™ll be able to use heading tags effectively to create a structured and visually appealing webpage.
